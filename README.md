# Movie-Recommendation-System
## Big Data Project for movie recommendation

Recommender systems are designed to anticipate users' interests and propose products that 
are likely to be of interest to them. They are one of the most sophisticated machine learning 
algorithms used by internet businesses to boost sales.

The goal is to create a recommendation system for the Movie Lens dataset; however, the 
model may be applied to any dataset. Our Objective is to create a recommendation system that 
uses movie and user information to suggest movies to new users based on their likes and prior 
choices.

We utilize the MovieLens-100k dataset, which is made up of a set of user ratings for 
movies taken from the MovieLens website, which is a movie recommendation service. There are 
943 users and 1664 movies on it.
